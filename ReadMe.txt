## Introduction

Libical â€” an implementation of iCalendar protocols and data formats

Most of the code in here was written by Eric Busboom with help from
dozens of contributors.  It is currently maintained by Art Cancro
and Wilfried Goesgens.

Libical is an Open Source implementation of the iCalendar protocols
and protocol data units. The iCalendar specification describes how
calendar clients can communicate with calendar servers so users can
store their calendar data and arrange meetings with other users.

Libical implements [RFC5545][], [RFC5546][], [RFC7529][]; the
CalDav scheduling extensions in [RFC6638][]; iCalendar extensions in [RFC7986][];
plus the iCalendar iMIP protocol in [RFC6047][].

[RFC5545]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5545
[RFC5546]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5546
[RFC7529]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7529
[RFC6638]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6638
[RFC6047]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6047
[RFC7986]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7986

This dual license ensures that the library can be incorporated into
both proprietary code and GPL'd programs, and will benefit from improvements
made by programmers in both realms. I will only accept changes into
my version of the library if they are similarly dual-licensed.

## Building

See the top-level [Install.txt](Install.txt) file.

## Documentation

There is rudimentary, unfinished documentation in the `doc/` directory,
see [UsingLibical.md](doc/UsingLibical.md)
and annotated examples in `examples/` and the test code in `src/test/`.

Additionally, progress is underway to add Doxygen documentation
for libical, which is available [here](http://libical.github.io/libical/apidocs/index.html)
